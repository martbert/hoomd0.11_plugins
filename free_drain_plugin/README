Files that come in this template:
 - CMakeLists.txt   : main CMake configuration file for the plugin
 - FindHOOMD.cmake  : script to find a HOOMD-Blue installation to link against
 - README           : This file
 - cppmodule        : Directory containing C++ and CUDA source code that interacts with HOOMD
 - pymodule         : Directory containing python UI level source code that drives the C++ module
 
To compile this example plugin, follow steps similar to those in compiling HOOMD-Blue. The process of finding a HOOMD 
installation to link to will be fully automatic IF you have hoomd_install_dir/bin in your PATH when running ccmake.

Note that plugins can only be built against a hoomd build that has been installed via a package or compiled and then
installed via 'make install'. Plugins can only be built against hoomd when it is built as a shared library.

$ mkdir plugin_build
$ cd plugin_build
$ ccmake /hoomd_install_dir/share/hoomd/plugin_template_cpp 
(follow normal cmake steps)
$ make -j6
$ make install

After running make install, you will find that the plugin has been copied into 
/hoomd_install_dir/lib/hoomd/python_module/hoomd_plugins/plugin_template (assuming you didn't change 
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.

The plugin can now be used in any hoomd script.
Example of how to use an installed plugin:

from hoomd_script import *
from hoomd_plugins import plugin_template
init.create_random(N=1000, phi_p=0.20)
plugin_template.update.example(period=10)

To create a plugin that actually does something useful
 - copy plugin_template_cpp to a new location
 - change the PROJECT() line in CMakeLists.txt to the name of your new plugin. This is the name that it will install to
 - Modify the source in cppmodule and pymodule. The existing files in those directories serve as examples and include
   many of the details in comments.
